## Overview

### Levels

#### Level 0

Run a simple node.js webserver, to enter level 1

```
root@dungeon:/# LVL0
You enter level 0.
You see a server.js file in your directory.

You try to run it with 'node server.js'
Nothing happens.

```

Challenges:

* Examine the contents of `server.js` file.
* Install nodejs and npm.
* Find out your ip address.
* Visit site in your web browser.
* ðŸ”® Send command to check if server is running from your host computer.

#### Level 1

Run an express node.js webserver.

```
root@dungeon:/srv/level0# LVL1
localhost [127.0.0.1] 8080 (http-alt) open
You enter level 1.
You see a more fancy file in your directory.

You notice a package. But don't know what to do with it

```

Challenges:

* Install packages.
* Start server (hint: you may need to make a small change in the server code)
* Inspect code (`cat`) and send payload to server (hint: `curl`).

#### Finish

If you send the payload to the server, then type the command `ASCEND`. You should complete the dungeon! Taking any shortcuts might lead to failure!

```bash
Golden key found...

The golden key unlocks the invisible stairs. You climb and see daylight.
The dungeon begins to crumble...but you escape.
